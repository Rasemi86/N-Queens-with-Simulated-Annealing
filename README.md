Solving N-Queen Problem with Stimulated Annealing
=============

ABSTRACT
--------
In this paper, we discuss about using stimulated annealing approach to solve N-queen problem which represents the class of NP-complete problem. This paper includes brief description about NP-complete problems, a detailed discussion on using stimulated annealing approach and a demonstrative algorithm to solve N-queens problem.
